**ble version**: <!-- The version and commit-hash or the result of `echo "$BLE_VERSION"` -->
**Bash version**: <!-- The result of `echo "$BASH_VERSION ($MACHTYPE)"` -->
<!-- You can instead copy and paste the result of pressing [Ctrl-x][Ctrl-v] in
  the ble.sh session. -->

<!-- Describe the problem here.  If example terminal contents (in either the
  text form or an image) are available, you may paste/insert them to explain
  the situation more clearly.

  Note: In most cases, in reply, we will ask further questions to investigate
  the problem in detail.  Please don't hesitate to RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS, or
  otherwise we need to just close the issue soon.  But don't worry!  Any
  (stupid) responses are welcome!  It's definitely better than NO RESPONSE.
  Let's communicate!

```console
$ ble summary

<!-- Include the output of the above command in the ble.sh session in which the
  problem occurs.  If you cannot get the command result, see
  https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Reporting-Issue#user-content-ble-summary
-->
```

<!-- Describe the problem here.

  Additionally, if example terminal contents (in either the text or image form)
  are available, you may paste/insert them to explain the situation more
  clearly.  Even with examples, please explain "what you did" and "what you
  expect" in text.  For details, see
  https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Reporting-Issue#user-content-video

  Note: In most cases, in reply, we will ask further questions to investigate
  the problem in detail.  Please don't hesitate to RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS, or
  otherwise we need to just close the issue soon.  But don't worry!  Any
  (stupid) responses are welcome!  It's definitely better than NO RESPONSE.
  Let's communicate!

*Bash Line Editor* (`ble.sh`<sup><a href="#discl-pronun">†1</a></sup>) is a command line editor written in pure Bash<sup><a href="#discl-pure">†2</a></sup> which replaces the default GNU Readline.

The current devel version is 0.4.
This script supports Bash 3.0 or higher although we recommend using `ble.sh` with release versions of **Bash 4.0 or higher**.
The POSIX standard utilities are also required.
Currently, only `UTF-8` encoding is supported for non-ASCII characters.
This script is provided under the [**BSD License**](LICENSE.md) (3-clause BSD license).

## Quick instructions

<!-- In macOS, you might additionally need to install `gawk`, `nawk`, or `mawk` since macOS `/usr/bin/awk` (awk-32 and later) seems to have a problem with some multibyte charsets. -->
There are two ways to get `ble.sh`: to get the source using `git` and build
`ble.sh`, or to download the [nightly build](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/releases/tag/nightly) using `curl` or `wget`.
See [Sec 1.1](#get-from-source) and [Sec 1.2](#get-from-tarball) for the details of trial and installation.
See [Sec 1.3](#set-up-bashrc) for the details of the setup of your `~/.bashrc`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to **use fzf with `ble.sh`**, you need to check [Sec
> 2.8](#fzf-integration).

<details open><summary><b>Download source using <code>git</code> and make <code>ble.sh</code></b></summary>

This requires the commands `git`, `make` (GNU make), and `gawk` (GNU awk)<sup><a href="#discl-pronun">†3</a></sup>.
In the following, please replace `make` with `gmake` if your system provides GNU make as `gmake` (such as in BSD).

```bash
# TRIAL without installation

git clone --recursive --depth 1 --shallow-submodules https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh.git
make -C ble.sh
source ble.sh/out/ble.sh

# Quick INSTALL to BASHRC (If this doesn't work, please follow Sec 1.3)

git clone --recursive --depth 1 --shallow-submodules https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh.git
make -C ble.sh install PREFIX=~/.local
echo 'source ~/.local/share/blesh/ble.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
```

The build process integrates multiple Bash script files into a single Bash script `ble.sh` with pre-processing.
It also places other module files in appropriate places and strips code comments for a shorter initialization time.
The build process does not involve any C/C++/Fortran compilations and generating binaries, so C/C++/Fortran compilers are not needed.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Download the nightly build with <code>curl</code></b></summary>

This requires the commands `curl`, `tar` (with the support for the `J` flag), and `xz` (XZ Utils).

```bash
# TRIAL without installation

curl -L https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/releases/download/nightly/ble-nightly.tar.xz | tar xJf -
source ble-nightly/ble.sh

# Quick INSTALL to BASHRC (If this doesn't work, please follow Sec 1.3)

curl -L https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/releases/download/nightly/ble-nightly.tar.xz | tar xJf -
bash ble-nightly/ble.sh --install ~/.local/share
echo 'source ~/.local/share/blesh/ble.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
```

After the installation, the directory `ble-nightly` can be removed.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Download the nightly build with <code>wget</code></b></summary>

This requires the commands `wget`, `tar` (with the support for the `J` flag), and `xz` (XZ Utils).

```bash
# TRIAL without installation

# UPDATE (in a ble.sh session)

ble-update

# UPDATE (outside ble.sh sessions)

bash /path/to/ble.sh --update
```
</details>

<details><summary><b>Create a package of <code>ble.sh</code></b></summary>

Since `ble.sh` is just a set of shell scripts and do not contain any binary (i.e., "`noarch`"),
you may just download the pre-built tarball from a release page and put the extracted contents in e.g. `/tmp/blesh-package/usr/local`.
Nevertheless, if you need to build the package from the source, please use the following commands.
Note that the git repository (`.git`) is required for the build.

```bash
# BUILD & PACKAGE (for package maintainers)

git clone --recursive https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh.git
make -C ble.sh install DESTDIR=/tmp/blesh-package PREFIX=/usr/local
```

For a detailed control of the install locations of the main files, the license
files, and the documentation files, please also check the later sections
[Install](#install) and [Package](#package).

If you want to tell `ble.sh` the way to update the package for `ble-update`,
you can place `_package.bash` at `${prefix}/share/blesh/lib/_package.bash`.
Please check [`_package.bash`](#_packagebash) for the details.

```bash
# ${prefix}/share/blesh/lib/_package.bash

_ble_base_package_type=XXX
function ble/base/package:XXX/update {
  update-the-package-in-a-proper-way
}
```
</details>

## Features

- **Syntax highlighting**: Highlight command lines input by users as in `fish` and `zsh-syntax-highlighting`.
  Unlike the simple highlighting in `zsh-syntax-highlighting`, `ble.sh` performs syntactic analysis
  to enable the correct highlighting of complex structures such as nested command substitutions, multiple here documents, etc.
  Highlighting colors and styles are [fully configurable](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A72-Graphics).
- **Enhanced completion**:
  Extend [completion](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A77-Completion)
  by **syntax-aware completion**, completion with quotes and parameter expansions in prefix texts, **ambiguous candidate generation**, etc.
  Also, [**menu-complete**](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A77-Completion#user-content-sec-menu-complete)
  supports the selection of candidates in the menu (candidate list) by cursor keys, <kbd>TAB</kbd>, and <kbd>S-TAB</kbd>.
  The feature [**auto-complete**](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A77-Completion#user-content-sec-auto-complete)
  supports the automatic suggestion of completed texts as in `fish` and `zsh-autosuggestions` (with Bash 4.0+).
  The feature [**menu-filter**](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A77-Completion#user-content-sec-menu-filter)
  integrates automatic filtering of candidates into menu completion (with Bash 4.0+).
  There are other functionalities such as
  [**dabbrev**](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A77-Completion#user-content-sec-dabbrev) and
  [**sabbrev**](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A77-Completion#user-content-sec-sabbrev) like
  [*zsh abbreviations*](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/6152/zsh-alias-expansion) or [`zsh-abbr`](https://github.com/olets/zsh-abbr).
- **Vim editing mode**: Enhance `readline`'s vi editing mode available with `set -o vi`.
  Vim editing mode supports various vim modes such as char/line/block visual/select mode, replace mode,
  command mode, operator pending mode as well as insert mode and normal mode.
  Vim editing mode supports various operators, text objects, registers, keyboard macros, marks, etc.
  It also provides `vim-surround` as an option.
- Other interesting features include
  [**status line**](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A74-Editing#user-content-bleopt-prompt_status_line),
  [**history share**](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A74-Editing#user-content-bleopt-history_share),
  [**right prompt**](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A74-Editing#user-content-bleopt-prompt_rps1),
  [**transient prompt**](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A74-Editing#user-content-bleopt-prompt_ps1_transient),
  [**xterm title**](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A74-Editing#user-content-bleopt-prompt_xterm_title), etc.

Note: ble.sh does not provide specific settings of the prompt, aliases, functions, etc.
ble.sh provides a more fundamental infrastructure so that users can set up their own prompt, aliases, functions, etc.
Of course ble.sh can be used in combination with other Bash configurations such as [`bash-it`](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it) and [`oh-my-bash`](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash).

## History and roadmap

My little experiment took place in one corner of my `bashrc` at the end of May 2013 after I enjoyed an article on `zsh-syntax-highlighting`.
I initially thought something could be achieved by writing a few hundred lines of code
but soon realized that everything needs to be re-implemented for the authentic support of syntax highlighting in Bash.
I decided to make it as an independent script `ble.sh`.
The name stemmed from that of Zsh's line editor, *ZLE* (*Zsh Line Editor*), but suffixed with `.sh` for the implication of being written in a shell script.
I'm occasionally asked about the pronunciation of `ble.sh`, but you can pronounce it as you like.
After the two-week experiment, I was satisfied with my conclusion that it is *possible* to implement a full-featured line editor in Bash that satisfies the actual daily uses.
The real efforts to improve the prototype implementation for real uses started in February 2015.
I released the initial version in the next December. Until then, the basic part of the line editor was completed.
The implementation of vim mode was started in September 2017 and completed in the next March.
I started working on the enhancement of the completion in August 2018 and released it in the next February.

- 2013-06 v0.0 -- prototype
- 2015-12 v0.1 -- Syntax highlighting [[v0.1.15](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/releases/tag/v0.1.15)]
- 2018-03 v0.2 -- Vim mode [[v0.2.7](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/releases/tag/v0.2.7)]
- 2019-02 v0.3 -- Enhanced completion [[v0.3.4](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/releases/tag/v0.3.4)]
- 20xx-xx v0.4 (plan) -- programmable highlighting [[nightly build](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/releases/tag/nightly)]
- 20xx-xx v0.5 (plan) -- TUI configuration
- 20xx-xx v0.6 (plan) -- error diagnostics?

## Limitations and assumptions

There are some limitations due to the way `ble.sh` is implemented.
Also, some user configurations or other Bash frameworks may conflict with ble.sh.
For example,

- By default, `ble.sh` does not set `PIPESTATUS` for the previous command line
  because it adds extra execution costs.  Instead, the array `BLE_PIPESTATUS`
  contains the values of `PIPESTATUS` of the previous command line.  If you
  need to access the values directly through the variable `PIPESTATUS`, please
  set the option `bleopt exec_restore_pipestatus=1`.
- By default, `ble.sh` assumes that `PROMPT_COMMAND` and `PRECMD` hooks do not
  change the cursor position and the layout in the terminal display to offer
  smooth rendering.  If you have settings that output texts or changes the
  cursor position in `PROMPT_COMMAND` and `PRECMD`, please set the option
  `bleopt prompt_command_changes_layout=1`.
- `ble.sh` assumes that common variable names and environment variables (such as `LC_*`) are not used for the global readonly variables.
  In Bash, global readonly variables take effect in any scope including the local scope of the function, which means that we cannot even define a local variable that has the same name as a global readonly variable.
  This is not the problem specific to `ble.sh`, but any Bash framework may suffer from the global readonly variables.
  It is generally not recommended to define global readonly variables in Bash except for the security reasoning
  (Refs. [[1]](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2019-03/threads.html#00150), [[2]](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2020-04/threads.html#00200), [[3]](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashProgramming?highlight=%28%22readonly%22%20flag,%20or%20an%20%22integer%22%20flag,%20but%20these%20are%20mostly%20useless,%20and%20serious%20scripts%20shouldn%27t%20be%20using%20them%29#Variables)).
  Also, `ble.sh` overrides the builtin `readonly` with a shell function to prevent it from making global variables readonly.
  It allows only uppercase global variables and `_*` to become readonly except `_ble_*`, `__ble_*`, and some special uppercase variables.
- `ble.sh` overrides Bash's built-in commands (`trap`, `readonly`, `bind`, `history`, `read`, and `exit`) with shell functions to adjust the behavior of each built-in command and prevent them from interfering with `ble.sh`.
  If the user or another framework directly calls the original builtins through `builtin BUILTIN`, or if the user or another framework replaces the shell functions, the behavior is undefined.
- The shell and terminal settings for the line editor and the command execution
  are different.  `ble.sh` adjusts them for the line editor and try to restore
  the settings for the command execution.  However, there are settings that
  cannot be restored or are intentionally not restored for various reasons.
  Some of them are summarized on [a wiki
  page](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Internals#internal-and-external).

## Criticism

- <sup><a id="discl-pronun" href="#discl-pronun">†1</a></sup>Q. *It is hard to
  pronounce "ble-sh". How should I pronounce it?* --- A. The easiest
  pronunciation of `ble.sh` that users use is /blɛʃ/, but you can pronounce it
  as you like.  I do not specify the canonical way of pronouncing `ble.sh`.  In
  fact, I personally call it simply /biːɛliː/ or verbosely read it as /biːɛliː
  dɑt ɛseɪtʃ/ in my head.
- <sup><a id="discl-pure" href="#discl-pure">†2</a></sup>Q. *It cannot be pure
  Bash because the user should be able to input and run external commands.
  What does the pure Bash mean?* --- A. It means that the core part of the line
  editor is written in pure Bash.  Of course, the external commands will be run
  when the user inputs them and requests the execution of them.  In addition,
  before and after the execution of user commands, `ble.sh` relies on POSIX
  `stty` to set up the correct TTY states for user commands.  It also uses
  other POSIX utilities for acceleration in some parts of initialization and
  cleanup code, processing of large data in completions, pasting large data,
  etc.  The primary goal of the `ble.sh` implementation is not being pure Bash,
  but the performance in the Bash implementation with the POSIX environment.
  Being pure Bash is usually useful for reducing the `fork`/`exec` cost, but if
  implementation by external commands is more efficient in specific parts,
  `ble.sh` will use the external commands there.
- <sup><a id="discl-make" href="#discl-make">†3</a></sup>Q. *Why does `ble.sh`
  use `make` to generate the script files? You should not use `make` for a
  script framework.* --- A. Because it is not a good idea to directly edit a
  large script file of tens of thousands of lines.  I split the codebase of
  `ble.sh` into source files of reasonable sizes and edit the source files.  In
  the build process, some source files are combined to form the main script
  `ble.sh`, and some other files are arranged in appropriate places.  The
  reason for combining the files into one file instead of sourcing the related
  files in runtime is to minimize the shell startup time, which has a large
  impact on the shell experience.  Opening and reading many files can take a
  long time.  Some people seem to be angry about `ble.sh` using `make` to build
  and arrange script files.  They seem to believe that one always needs to use
  `make` with C/C++/Fortran compilers to generate binaries.  They complain
  about `ble.sh`'s make process, but it comes from the lack of knowledge on the
  general principle of `make`.  Some people seem to be angry about `ble.sh`
  having C/C++ source codes in the repository, but they are used to update the
  Unicode character table from the Unicode database when a new Unicode standard
  appears.  The generated table is included in the repository:
  [`canvas.GraphemeClusterBreak.sh`](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/blob/master/src/canvas.GraphemeClusterBreak.sh),
  [`canvas.c2w.musl.sh`](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/blob/master/src/canvas.c2w.musl.sh),
  [`canvas.c2w.sh`](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/blob/master/src/canvas.c2w.sh),
  and
  [`canvas.emoji.sh`](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/blob/master/src/canvas.emoji.sh),
  so there is no need to run these C/C++ programs in the build process.
  Another C file is used as an adapter in an old system MSYS1, which is used
  with an old compiler toolchain in Windows, but it will never be used in
  Unix-like systems.  Each file used in the build process is explained in
  [`make/README.md`](make/README.md).

# 1 Usage

## 1.1 Build from source<sup><a id="get-from-source" href="#get-from-source">†</a></sup>

### Generate

To generate `ble.sh`, `gawk` (GNU awk) and `gmake` (GNU make) (in addition to Bash and POSIX standard utilities) are required.
The file `ble.sh` can be generated using the following commands.
If you have GNU make installed on `gmake`, please use `gmake` instead of `make`.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh.git
cd ble.sh
make
```

A script file `ble.sh` will be generated in the directory `ble.sh/out`.

### Try

Then, you can load `ble.sh` in the Bash session using the `source` command:
```bash
source out/ble.sh
```

### Install

To install `ble.sh` in a specified directory, use `make install`.

```
# INSTALL to ~/.local/share/blesh and ~/.local/share/doc/blesh
make install

# INSTALL into a specified directory
make install INSDIR=/path/to/blesh
```

The install locations of `ble.sh` and related script files can be specified by
make variable `INSDIR`.  The locations of the license files and the
documentation files can be specified by make variables `INSDIR_LICENSE` and
`INSDIR_DOC`, respectively.  When `INSDIR` is specified, the default values of
`INSDIR_LICENSE` and `INSDIR_DOC` are `$INSDIR/licenses` and `$INSDIR/doc`.
When `INSDIR` and the below-mentioned `DESTDIR`/`PREFIX` are not specified, the
default values of `INSDIR`, `INSDIR_LICENSES`, and `INSDIR_DOC` are
`$data/blesh`, `$data/blesh/licenses`, and `$data/doc/blesh`, respectively,
where `$data` represents `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/blesh`.

When `USE_DOC=no` is specified, the documentation files are disabled.

By default, the comment lines and blank lines in the script files are stripped
in the installation process.  If you would like to keep these lines in the
script files, please specify the argument `strip_comment=no` to `make`.

To set up `.bashrc` see [Sec. 1.3](#set-up-bashrc).

### Package

Package maintainers may use make variables `DESTDIR` and `PREFIX` to quickly
set up the default values for `INSDIR`, `INSDIR_LICENSE`, and `INSDIR_DOC`.

```bash
# PACKAGE - Example 1
make install DESTDIR=/tmp/blesh-package PREFIX=/usr/local

# PACKAGE - Example 2
make install DESTDIR="$build" PREFIX="$prefix" \
  INSDIR_LICENSE="$build/$prefix/share/licenses/blesh"

# PACKAGE - Example 3
make install DESTDIR="$build" PREFIX="$prefix" \
  INSDIR_LICENSE="$build/$prefix/share/blesh/doc" \
  INSDIR_DOC="$build/$prefix/share/blesh/doc"

# PACKAGE - Example 4
make install USE_DOC=no DESTDIR="$build" PREFIX="$prefix"
```

If make variable `DESTDIR` or `PREFIX` is specified instead of `INSDIR`, the
value of `INSDIR` is set to `$DESTDIR/$PREFIX/share/blesh`, and the default
install locations of the license and documentation files, `INSDIR_LICENSE` and
`INSDIR_DOC`, will be `$DESTDIR/$PREFIX/share/doc/blesh`.

#### `_package.bash`

When you want to tell `ble.sh` the way to update the package for `ble-update`,
you can place `_package.bash` at `${prefix}/share/blesh/lib/_package.bash`.
The file `_package.bash` is supposed to define a shell variable and a shell
function as illustrated in the following example (please replace `XXX` with a
name representing the package management system):

```bash
# ${prefix}/share/blesh/lib/_package.bash

_ble_base_package_type=XXX

function ble/base/package:XXX/update {
  update-the-package-in-a-proper-way
  return 0
}
```

When the shell function returns exit status 0, it means that the update has been successfully completed, and `ble.sh` will be reloaded automatically.
When the shell function returns exit status 6, the timestamp of `ble.sh` will be checked so `ble.sh` is reloaded only when `ble.sh` is actually updated.
When the shell function returns exit status 125, the default `ble.sh` update procedure is attempted.
Otherwise, the updating procedure is canceled, where any message explaining situation should be output by the shell function.
An example `_package.bash` for `AUR` can be found [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/blesh-update.sh?h=blesh-git).

## 1.2 Download a tarball<sup><a id="get-from-tarball" href="#get-from-tarball">†</a></sup>

You can also download a tarball of `ble.sh` from GitHub releases.
See each release page for the description of downloading, trial and installation.
Many features are unavailable in the stable versions since they are significantly old compared to the devel version.

- Devel [v0.4.0-devel3](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/releases/tag/v0.4.0-devel3) (2023-04), [nightly build](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/releases/tag/nightly)
- Stable [v0.3.4](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/releases/tag/v0.3.4) (2019-02 fork) Enhanced completions
- Stable [v0.2.7](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/releases/tag/v0.2.7) (2018-03 fork) Vim mode
- Stable [v0.1.15](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/releases/tag/v0.1.15) (2015-12 fork) Syntax highlighting

## 1.3 Set up `.bashrc`<sup><a id="set-up-bashrc" href="#set-up-bashrc">†</a></sup>

If you want to load `ble.sh` in interactive sessions of `bash` by default, usually one can just source `ble.sh` in `~/.bashrc`,
but a more reliable way is to add the following codes to your `.bashrc` file:

```bash
# bashrc

# Add this lines at the top of .bashrc:
[[ $- == *i* ]] && source /path/to/blesh/ble.sh --noattach

# your bashrc settings come here...

# Add this line at the end of .bashrc:
[[ ! ${BLE_VERSION-} ]] || ble-attach
```

Basically, when `source /path/to/ble.sh` and `ble-attach` are performed,
standard streams (`stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`) should not be redirected but should be connected to the controlling TTY of the current session.
Also, please avoid calling `source /path/to/ble.sh` in shell functions.
The detailed conditions where the above *more reliable setup* is needed are explained in [an answer in Discussion #254](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/discussions/254#discussioncomment-4284757).

## 1.4 User settings `~/.blerc`

User settings can be placed in the init script `~/.blerc` (or `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/blesh/init.sh` if `~/.blerc` is not available)
whose template is available as the file [`blerc.template`](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/blob/master/blerc.template) in the repository.
The init script is a Bash script that is sourced during the load of `ble.sh`, so any shell commands can be used in `~/.blerc`.
If you want to change the default path of the init script, you can add the option `--rcfile INITFILE` to `source ble.sh` as the following example:

```bash
# in bashrc

# Example 1: ~/.blerc will be used by default
[[ $- == *i* ]] && source /path/to/blesh/ble.sh --noattach

# Example 2: /path/to/your/blerc will be used
[[ $- == *i* ]] && source /path/to/blesh/ble.sh --noattach --rcfile /path/to/your/blerc
```

## 1.5 Update

You need Git (`git`), GNU awk (`gawk`) and GNU make (`make`).
For `ble-0.3+`, you can run `ble-update` in the session with `ble.sh` loaded:

```bash
$ ble-update
```

For `ble.0.4+`, you can also update it outside the `ble.sh` session using

```bash
$ bash /path/to/ble.sh --update
```

You can instead download the latest version by `git pull` and install it:

```bash
cd ble.sh   # <-- enter the git repository you already have
git pull
git submodule update --recursive --remote
make
make INSDIR="$HOME/.local/share/blesh" install
```

## 1.6 Uninstall

Basically you can simply delete the installed directory and the settings that the user added.

- Close all the `ble.sh` sessions (the Bash interactive sessions with `ble.sh`)
- Remove related user data. If you would like to keep them, you can skip these steps.
  - Remove the added lines in `.bashrc`.
  - Remove `blerc` files (`~/.blerc` or `~/.config/blesh/init.sh`) if any.
  - Remove the state directory `~/.local/state/blesh` if any.
- Remove the directory where `ble.sh` is installed.  When you use `out/ble.sh`
  inside the working tree of the git repository, the installed directory is the
  directory of the repository.  When you use `ble.sh` installed by `make
  install`, the installed directory is `<PREFIX>/share/blesh` where `<PREFIX>`
  (default: `~/.local`) is the prefix specified to `make install` in the
  installation stage.  When you use the version extracted from a tarball, the
  directory created by extracting the tarball is the installed directory.
- Remove the cache directory `~/.cache/blesh` if any.
- Remove the temporary directory `/tmp/blesh` if any [ Only needed when your system does not automatically clear `/tmp` ].

# 2 Basic settings

Here, some of the settings for `~/.blerc` are picked up.

## 2.1 Vim mode

For the vi/vim mode, check [the wiki page](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Vi-(Vim)-editing-mode).

## 2.2 Disable features

One of frequently asked questions is the way to disable a specific feature that `ble.sh` adds.
Here the settings for disabling features are summarized.

```bash
# Disable syntax highlighting
bleopt highlight_syntax=

# Disable highlighting based on filenames
bleopt highlight_filename=

# Disable highlighting based on variable types
bleopt highlight_variable=

# Disable auto-complete (Note: auto-complete is enabled by default in bash-4.0+)
bleopt complete_auto_complete=
# Tip: you may instead specify the delay of auto-complete in millisecond
bleopt complete_auto_delay=300

# Disable auto-complete based on the command history
bleopt complete_auto_history=

# Disable ambiguous completion
bleopt complete_ambiguous=

# Disable menu-complete by TAB
bleopt complete_menu_complete=

# Disable menu filtering (Note: auto-complete is enabled by default in bash-4.0+)
bleopt complete_menu_filter=

# Disable EOF marker like "[ble: EOF]"
bleopt prompt_eol_mark=''
# Tip: you may instead specify another string:
bleopt prompt_eol_mark='⏎'

# Disable error exit marker like "[ble: exit %d]"
bleopt exec_errexit_mark=
# Tip: you may instead specify another string:
bleopt exec_errexit_mark=$'\e[91m[error %d]\e[m'

# Disable elapsed-time marker like "[ble: elapsed 1.203s (CPU 0.4%)]"
bleopt exec_elapsed_mark=
# Tip: you may instead specify another string
bleopt exec_elapsed_mark=$'\e[94m[%ss (%s %%)]\e[m'
# Tip: you may instead change the threshold of showing the mark
bleopt exec_elapsed_enabled='sys+usr>=10*60*1000' # e.g. ten minutes for total CPU usage

# Disable exit marker like "[ble: exit]"
bleopt exec_exit_mark=

# Disable some other markers like "[ble: ...]"
bleopt edit_marker=
bleopt edit_marker_error=
```

## 2.3 CJK Width

The option `char_width_mode` controls the width of the Unicode characters with `East_Asian_Width=A` (Ambiguous characters).
Currently, four values `emacs`, `west`, `east`, and `auto` are supported. With the value `emacs`, the default width in emacs is used.
With `west`, all the ambiguous characters have width 1 (Hankaku). With `east`, all the ambiguous characters have width 2 (Zenkaku).
With `auto`, the width mode `west` or `east` is automatically chosen based on the terminal behavior.
The default value is `auto`. The appropriate value should be chosen in accordance with your terminal behavior.
For example, the value can be changed to `west` as:

```bash
bleopt char_width_mode='west'
```

## 2.4 Input Encoding

The option `input_encoding` controls the encoding scheme used in the decode of input. Currently `UTF-8` and `C` are available. With the value `C`, byte values are directly interpreted as character codes. The default value is `UTF-8`. For example, the value can be changed to `C` as:

```bash
bleopt input_encoding='C'
```

## 2.5 Bell

The option `edit_bell` controls the behavior of the edit function (widget)
called `bell`.  It is a colon-separated list of the values `vbell`, `abell`,
and `visual`.  When a value is contained, the corresponding type of the bell is
enabled.  The value `abell` corresponds to the audible bell, which prints ASCII
Control Character <kbd>BEL</kbd> (0x07) will be written to `stderr`.  The value
`vbell` corresponds to the visible bell, which shows the message in the
terminal display.  The value `visual` corresponds to the visual bell, which
flashes the terminal screen by turning on the <kbd>DECSCNM</kbd> mode for a
short moment.  By default, only the audible bell is enabled.

The option `vbell_default_message` specifies the default message shown by the
visual bell. The default value of this setting is `' Wuff, -- Wuff!! '`. The
option `vbell_duration` specifies the display duration of the visual-bell
message. The unit is a millisecond. The default value is `2000`.  The option
`vbell_align` specifies the position of `vbell` by `left`, `center`, or
`right`.

For example, the audible bell can be disabled, and the visual bell can be set
up as:

```bash
bleopt edit_bell=vbell vbell_{default_message=' BEL ',duration=3000,align=right}
```

## 2.6 Highlight Colors

The colors and attributes used in the syntax highlighting are controlled by the function `ble-face`. The following code reproduces the default configuration:
```bash
# highlighting related to editing
ble-face -s region                    bg=60,fg=231
ble-face -s region_target             bg=153,fg=black

ble-face -s menu_desc_default         none
ble-face -s menu_desc_type            ref:syntax_delimiter
ble-face -s menu_desc_quote           ref:syntax_quoted
ble-face -s menu_filter_fixed         bold
ble-face -s menu_filter_input         fg=16,bg=229
```

The current list of faces can be obtained by the following command (`ble-face` without arguments):
```console
$ ble-face
```

The color codes can be checked in output of the function `ble-color-show` (defined in `ble.sh`):
```console
$ ble-color-show
```

## 2.7 Key Bindings

Key bindings can be controlled with the shell function, `ble-bind`.
For example, with the following setting, "Hello, world!" will be inserted on typing <kbd>C-x h</kbd>
```bash
ble-bind -f 'C-x h' 'insert-string "Hello, world!"'
```

The details on the key representation, such as <kbd>C-x h</kbd> in the above example,
are described in [Manual §3.1](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A73-Key-Binding#user-content-sec-kspecs).
The representations of <kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Backspace</kbd>, <kbd>Escape</kbd>, etc. are described
in [Manual §3.1.1](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A73-Key-Binding#user-content-sec-kspecs-ret):
The space is represented as <kbd>SP</kbd>,
the tab key is represented as <kbd>C-i</kbd> or <kbd>TAB</kbd> depending on the terminal,
the enter/return key is represented as <kbd>C-m</kbd> or <kbd>RET</kbd> depending on the terminal,
and the backspace key is represented as <kbd>C-?</kbd>, <kbd>DEL</kbd>, <kbd>C-h</kbd>, or <kbd>BS</kbd> depending on the terminal.
The representations of modified special keys such as <kbd>Ctrl+Return</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+Return</kbd> are described
in [Manual §3.6.4](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A73-Key-Binding#user-content-sec-modifyOtherKeys-manual):
If your terminal does not support `modifyOtherKeys`, you need to manually configure the escape sequences of modified special keys.


For another example, if you want to invoke a command on typing <kbd>M-c</kbd>, you can write it as follows:

```bash
ble-bind -c 'M-c' 'my-command'
```

Or, if you want to invoke a edit function (designed for Bash `bind -x`) on typing <kbd>C-r</kbd>, you can write it as follows:

```bash
ble-bind -x 'C-r' 'my-edit-function'
```

The existing key bindings are shown by the following command:
```console
$ ble-bind -P
```

The list of widgets is shown by the following command:
```console
$ ble-bind -L
```

If you want to run multiple widgets with a key, you can define your own widget by creating a function of the name `ble/widget/YOUR_WIDGET_NAME`
as illustrated in the following example.
It is highly recommended to prefix the widget name with `YOUR_NAME/`, `my/`, `blerc/`, `dotfiles/`, etc.
in order not to conflict with the names of the existing standard widgets.

```bash
# Example of calling multiple widgets with the key C-t
function ble/widget/my/example1 {
  ble/widget/beginning-of-logical-line
  ble/widget/insert-string 'echo $('
  ble/widget/end-of-logical-line
  ble/widget/insert-string ')'
}
ble-bind -f C-t my/example1
```

## 2.8 fzf integration<sup><a id="fzf-integration" href="#fzf-integration">†</a></sup>

If you would like to use `fzf` in combination with `ble.sh`, you need to configure `fzf` using [the `contrib/fzf` integration](https://github.com/akinomyoga/blesh-contrib#pencil-fzf-integration).
Please follow the instructions in the link for the detailed description.

```bash
# blerc

# Note: If you want to combine fzf-completion with bash_completion, you need to
# load bash_completion earlier than fzf-completion.  This is required
# regardless of whether to use ble.sh or not.
source /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh

ble-import -d integration/fzf-completion
ble-import -d integration/fzf-key-bindings
```

The option `-d` of `ble-import` delays the initialization.  In this way, the
fzf settings are loaded in background after the prompt is shown.  See
[`ble-import` - Manual §8](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A78-Miscellaneous#user-content-fn-ble-import)
for details.

### When you have additional configuration for fzf

When you want to run codes of the additional configuration after the fzf
settings are loaded, you cannot simply write them after the above settings
because of the delayed loading of the fzf settings.  In this case, there are
four options.  The easiest way is to drop the `-d` option (Option 1 below) to
disable the delayed loading:

```bash
# [1] Drop -d
ble-import integration/fzf-completion
ble-import integration/fzf-key-bindings
<settings>
```

However, the above setting may make the initialization time longer.  As another
option, you may also delay the additional settings with `ble-import -d` [2] or
`ble/util/idle.push` [3].  Or, you can hook into the loading of the fzf
settings by `ble-import -C` [4].

```bash
# [2] Use ble-import -d for additional settings
ble-import -d integration/fzf-completion
ble-import -d integration/fzf-key-bindings
ble-import -d '<filename containing the settings>'

# [3] Use "ble/util/idle.push" for additional settings
ble-import -d integration/fzf-completion
ble-import -d integration/fzf-key-bindings
ble/util/idle.push '<settings>'

# [4] Use "ble-import -C" for additional settings
ble-import -d integration/fzf-completion
ble-import -d integration/fzf-key-bindings
ble-import -C '<settings>' integration/fzf-key-bindings
```

# 3 Tips

## 3.1 Use multiline mode

When the command line string contains a newline character, `ble.sh` enters the MULTILINE mode.

By typing <kbd>C-v C-j</kbd> or <kbd>C-q C-j</kbd>, you can insert a newline character in the command line string.
In the MULTILINE mode, <kbd>RET</kbd> (<kbd>C-m</kbd>) causes the insertion of a new newline character.
In the MULTILINE mode, the command can be executed by typing <kbd>C-j</kbd>.

When the shell option `shopt -s cmdhist` is set (which is the default),
<kbd>RET</kbd> (<kbd>C-m</kbd>) inserts a newline if the current command line string is syntactically incomplete.

## 3.2 Use vim editing mode

If `set -o vi` is specified in `.bashrc` or `set editing-mode vi` is specified in `.inputrc`, the vim mode is enabled.
For details, please check [the wiki page](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Vi-(Vim)-editing-mode).

## 3.3 Use `auto-complete`

The feature `auto-complete` is available in Bash 4.0 or later. `auto-complete` automatically suggests a possible completion on user input.
The suggested contents can be inserted by typing <kbd>S-RET</kbd>
(when the cursor is at the end of the command line, you can also use <kbd>right</kbd>, <kbd>C-f</kbd>, or <kbd>end</kbd> to insert the suggestion).
If you want to insert only the first word of the suggested contents, you can use <kbd>M-right</kbd> or <kbd>M-f</kbd>.
If you want to accept the suggestion and immediately run the command, you can use <kbd>C-RET</kbd>
(if your terminal does not support special key combinations like <kbd>C-RET</kbd>, please check
[Manual §3.6.4](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/wiki/Manual-%C2%A73-Key-Binding#user-content-sec-modifyOtherKeys-manual)).

## 3.4 Use `sabbrev` (static abbrev expansions)

By registering words to `sabbrev`, the words can be expanded to predefined strings.
When the cursor is just after a registered word, typing <kbd>SP</kbd> causes the `sabbrev` expansion.
For example, with the following settings, when you type <kbd>SP</kbd> after the string `command L`, the command line will be expanded to `command | less`.

```bash
# blerc
ble-sabbrev L='| less'
```

The sabbrev names that start with `\` plus alphabetical letters are also recommended since it is unlikely to conflict with real words that are a part of the executed command.

```bash
# blerc
ble-sabbrev '\L'='| less'
```

The sabbrevs starting with `~` can be expanded also by <kbd>/</kbd>.  This can be used to approximate Zsh's named directories.
For example, with the following settings, typing `~mybin/` expands it to e.g. `/home/user/bin/` (where we assumed `HOME=/home/user`).

```bash
# blerc

ble-sabbrev "~mybin=$HOME/bin"
```

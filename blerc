## Basic settings


## The following setting specifies the input encoding. Currently only "UTF-8"
## and "C" is available.

#bleopt input_encoding=UTF-8


## The following setting specifies the pager used by ble.sh.  This is used to
## show the help of commands (f1).

#bleopt pager=less

## The following setting specifies the editor used by ble.sh.  This is used for
## the widget edit-and-execute (C-x C-e) and editor for a large amount of
## command line texts.  Possible values include, for example, "vim", "emacs
## -nw" and "nano".

#bleopt editor=vim


## The following settings sets the behavior of visible bells (vbell).
## "vbell_duration" sets the time duration to show the vbell. "vbell_align"
## controls the position of vbell. The value "left" (default) specifies that
## the vbell should be shown up on the top left corner of the terminal. The
## values "center" and "right" specify that the vbell is shown on the top
## center and the top right corner, respectively.

#bleopt vbell_default_message=' Wuff, -- Wuff!! '
#bleopt vbell_duration=2000
#bleopt vbell_align=right


##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Line editor settings


## The following settings turns on/off the audible bells and visible bells for
## errors while user edit. The non-empty value turns on the bells.

#bleopt edit_abell=1
#bleopt edit_vbell=


## The following setting turns on the delayed load of history when an non-empty
## value is set.

#bleopt history_lazyload=1


## The following setting turns on the delete selection mode when an non-empty
## value is set. When the mode is turned on the selection is removed when a
## user inserts a character.

#bleopt delete_selection_mode=1


## The following settings control the indentation. "indent_offset" sets the
## indent width. "indent_tabs" controls if tabs can be used for indentation or
## not. If "indent_tabs" is set to 0, tabs will never be used. Otherwise
## indentation is made with tabs and spaces.

#bleopt indent_offset=4
#bleopt indent_tabs=1


## "undo_point" controls the cursor position after "undo". When "beg" or "end"
## is specified, the cursor will be moved to the beginning or the end of the
## dirty section, respectively. When other values are specified, the original
## cursor position is reproduced.

#bleopt undo_point=end


## The following setting controls forced layout calculations before graphical
## operations. When a non-empty value is specified, the forced calculations are
## enabled. When an empty string is set, the operations are switched to logical
## ones.

#bleopt edit_forced_textmap=1


## The following option controls the interpretation of lines when going to the
## beginning or the end of the current line.  When the value `logical` is
## specified, the logical line is used, i.e., the beginning and the end of the
## line is determined based on the newline characters in the edited text.  When
## the value `graphical` is specified, the graphical line is used, i.e., the
## beginning and the end of the displayed line in the terminal is used.

#bleopt edit_line_type=graphical


## The following option controls the position of the info pane where completion
## menu, mode names, and other information are shown.  When the value "top" is
## specified, the info pane is shown just below the command line.  When the
## value "bottom" is specified, the info pane is shown at the bottom of the
## terminal.  The default is "top".

#bleopt info_display=top


## The following settings controls the prompt after the cursor left the command
## line.  "prompt_ps1_final" contains a prompt string.  "prompt_ps1_transient"
## is a colon-separated list of fields "always", "same-dir" and "trim".  The
## prompt is replaced by "prompt_ps1_final" if it has a non-empty value.
## Otherwise, the prompt is trimmed leaving the last line if
## "prompt_ps1_transient" has a field "trim".  Otherwise, the prompt vanishes
## if "prompt_ps1_transient" has a non-empty value.  When
## "prompt_ps1_transient" contains a field "same-dir", the setting of
## "prompt_ps1_transient" is effective only when the current working directory
## did not change since the last command line.

#bleopt prompt_ps1_final=
#bleopt prompt_ps1_transient=trim


## The following settings controls the right prompt. "prompt_rps1" specifies
## the contents of the right prompt in the format of PS1.  When the cursor
## leaves the current command line, the right prompt is replaced by
## "prompt_rps1_final" if it has a non-empty value, or otherwise, the right
## prompt vanishes if "prompt_rps1_transient" is set to a non-empty value,

#bleopt prompt_rps1='\w'
#bleopt prompt_rps1_final=
#bleopt prompt_rps1_transient=''


## The following settings specify the content of terminal titles and status
## lines.  "prompt_xterm_title" specifies the terminal title which can be set
## by "OSC 0 ; ... BEL".  "prompt_screen_title" is effective inside terminal
## multiplexers such as GNU screen and tmux and specifies the window title of
## the terminal multiplexer which can be set by "ESC k ... ST".
## "prompt_term_status" is only effective when terminfo entries "tsl" and "fsl"
## (or termcap entries "ts" and "ds") are available, and specifies the content
## of the status line which can be set by the terminfo entries.  When each
## setting has non-empty value, the content of corresponding title or status
## line is replaced just before PS1 is shown.

#bleopt prompt_xterm_title=
#bleopt prompt_screen_title=
#bleopt prompt_term_status=


## The following settings control the status line.  "prompt_status_line"
## specifies the content of the status line.  If its value is empty, the status
## line is not shown.  "prompt_status_align" controls the position of the
## content in the status line.

#bleopt prompt_status_line=
#bleopt prompt_status_align=left


## "prompt_eol_mark" specifies the contents of the mark used to indicate the
## command output is not ended with newlines. The value can contain ANSI escape
## sequences.

#bleopt prompt_eol_mark=$'\e[94m[ble: EOF]\e[m'


## "exec_errexit_mark" specifies the format of the mark to show the exit status
## of the command when it is non-zero.  If this setting is an empty string the
## exit status will not be shown.  The value can contain ANSI escape sequences.

#bleopt exec_errexit_mark=$'\e[91m[ble: exit %d]\e[m'


## The following setting controls the exit when jobs are remaining. When an
## empty string is set, the shell will never exit with remaining jobs through
## widgets. When an non-empty value is set, the shell will exit when exit is
## attempted twice consecutively.

#bleopt allow_exit_with_jobs=


## The following setting controls the cursor position after the move to other
## history entries. When non-empty values are specified, the offset of the
## cursor from the beginning of the command line is preserved. When an empty
## value is specified the cursor position is the beginning or the end of the
## command lines when the move is to a newer or older entry, respectively.

#bleopt history_preserve_point=


## The following setting controls the history sharing. If it has non-empty
## value, the history sharing is enabled. With the history sharing, the command
## history is shared with the other Bash ble.sh sessions with the history
## sharing turned on.

#bleopt history_share=


## The following setting controls the behavior of the widget
## "accept-single-line-or-newline" in the single-line editing mode. The value
## is a subject of arithmetic evaluation. When it evaluates to negative
## integers, the line is always accepted. When it evaluates to 0, it enters the
## multiline editing mode when there is any unprocessed user inputs, or
## otherwise the line is accepted. When it evaluates to a positive integer "n",
## it enters the multiline editing mode when there is more than "n"unprocessed
## user inputs.

#bleopt accept_line_threshold=5


## The following option controls the behavior when the number of characters
## exceeds the capacity specified by `line_limit_length`.  The value `none`
## means that the number of characters will not be checked.  The value
## `discard` means that the characters cannot be inserted when the number of
## characters exceeds the capacity.  The value `truncate` means that the
## command line is truncated from its end to fit into the capacity.  The value
## `editor` means that the widget `edit-and-execute` will be invoked to open an
## editor to edit the command line contents.

#bleopt line_limit_type=none


## The following option specifies the capacity of the command line in the
## number of characters.  The number 0 or negative numbers means the unlimited
## capacity.

#bleopt line_limit_length=10000


## The following option specifies the maximal number of characters which can be
## appended into the history.  When this option has a positive value, commands
## with the length longer than the value is not appended to the history.  When
## this option has a non-positive value, commands are always appended to the
## history regardless of their length.

#bleopt history_limit_length=10000


##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Terminal state control


## The following setting specifies the cursor type when commands are executed.
## The cursor type is specified by the argument of the control function
## DECSCUSR.

#bleopt term_cursor_external=0


## The following settings, external and internal, specify the "modifyOtherKeys"
## states [the control function SM(>4)] when commands are executed and when
## ble.sh has control, respectively.

#bleopt term_modifyOtherKeys_external=auto
#bleopt term_modifyOtherKeys_internal=auto


##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Rendering options


## "tab_width" specifies the width of TAB on the command line. When an empty
## value is specified, the width in terminfo (tput it) is used.

#bleopt tab_width=


## "char_width_mode" specifies the width of East_Asian_Width=A characters.
## When the value "east" is specified, the width is 2. When the value "west"
## is specified, the width is 1. When "auto" is specified, "east" or "west"
## is automatically selected based on interactions with the terminal. When
## the value "emacs" is specified, the width table (depending on characters)
## used in Emacs is used.

#bleopt char_width_mode=auto


## "char_width_version" specifies the Unicode version that char width
## determination bases on.  When "auto" is specified, ble.sh
## automatically tests the behavior of the terminal on startup and try
## to determine the appropriate version.  Supported versions are
## "4.1", "5.0", "5.2", "6.0", "6.1", "6.2", "6.3", "7.0", "8.0",
## "9.0", "10.0", "11.0", "12.0", "12.1", and "13.0".  The default
## value is "auto".

#bleopt char_width_version=auto


## "emoji_width" specifies the width of emoji characters.  If an empty value is
## specified, special treatment of emoji is disabled.

#bleopt emoji_width=2


## "emoji_version" specifies the version of Unicode Emoji.  Available values
## are 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 11.0, 12.0, 12.1, 13.0, and 13.1.

#bleopt emoji_version=13.1

## "emoji_opts" is a colon-separated list that represents the terminal
## capability for emojis.  When "tpvs" and "epvs" are specified, TPVS and EPVS
## (text/emoji presentation variation selectors), respectively, can be used to
## change he representation of emoji characters.  When "zwj" is specified, the
## emoji ZWJ sequences are supported.  When "ri" is specified, the flag emojis
## formed by two Regional_Indicators are supported.  When "unqualified" is
## specified, unqualified emojis are treated as emojis as well as the qualified
## emojis.

#bleopt emoji_opts=tpvs:epvs:ri


##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## User input settings


## The following setting sets the default keymap. The value "emacs" specifies
## that the emacs keymap should be used. The value "vi" specifies that the vi
## keymap (insert mode) should be used as the default. The value "auto"
## specifies that the keymap should be automatically selected from "emacs" or
## "vi" according to the current readline state "set -o emacs" or "set -o vi".

#bleopt default_keymap=auto


## The following setting controls the treatment of isolated ESCs.  The value
## "esc" indicates that it should be treated as ESC.  The value "meta"
## indicates that it should be treated as Meta modifier.  The value "auto"
## indicates that the behavior will be switched to an appropriate side of "esc"
## or "meta" depending on the current keymap.

#bleopt decode_isolated_esc=esc


## The following setting specifies the byte code used to abort the currently
## processed inputs. The default value 28 corresponds to "C-\".

#bleopt decode_abort_char=28


## The following settings sets up the behavior for errors while user input
## decoding. "error_char" is the decoding error for the current character
## encoding. "error_cseq" indicates the unrecognized CSI sequences.
## "error_kseq" indicates the unbound key sequences. "abell" and "vbell" turn
## on/off the audible bells and visible bells on errors. If the variable is
## empty the bells are turned off, or otherwise turned on. "discard" controls
## if the chars/sequences will be discarded or processed in later stage. If a
## non-empty value is given, chars/sequences are discarded.

#bleopt decode_error_char_abell=
#bleopt decode_error_char_vbell=1
#bleopt decode_error_char_discard=
#bleopt decode_error_cseq_abell=
#bleopt decode_error_cseq_vbell=1
#bleopt decode_error_cseq_discard=1
#bleopt decode_error_kseq_abell=1
#bleopt decode_error_kseq_vbell=1
#bleopt decode_error_kseq_discard=1


##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Settings for completion


## The following settings turn on/off the corresponding functionalities. When
## non-empty strings are set, the functionality is enabled. Otherwise, the
## functionality is inactive.

#bleopt complete_auto_complete=1
#bleopt complete_menu_complete=1
#bleopt complete_menu_filter=1


## If "complete_ambiguous" has non-empty values, ambiguous completion
## candidates are generated for completion.

#bleopt complete_ambiguous=1


## If "complete_contract_function_names" has non-empty values, the function
## name candidates are grouped by prefixes of the directory-like form "*/".

#bleopt complete_contract_function_names=1


## By default, ble.sh does not allow rewriting the existing text if non-unique
## candidates does not contain the existing text.  If this setting has
## non-empty values, ble.sh rewrites the existing text.

#bleopt complete_allow_reduction=1


## If "complete_auto_history" has non-empty values, auto-complete searches
## matching command lines from history.

#bleopt complete_auto_history=1


## The following setting controls the delay of auto-complete after the last
## user input. The unit is millisecond.

#bleopt complete_auto_delay=100


## The setting "complete_auto_wordbreaks" is used as the delimiters for
## identifying words for M-right (auto-complete/insert-word).  The default
## value is $' \t\n'.  If the empty value is set, the default value is used.

#bleopt complete_auto_wordbreaks=$' \t\n/'


## The setting "complete_auto_menu" controls the delay of "auto-menu".  When a
## non-empty string is set, auto-menu is enabled.  The string is evaluated as
## an arithmetic expression to give the delay in milliseconds.  ble.sh will
## automatically show the menu of completions after the idle time (for which
## user input does not arrive) reaches the delay.

#bleopt complete_auto_menu=500


## When there are user inputs while generating completion candidates, the
## candidates generation will be canceled to process the user inputs. The
## following setting controls the interval of checking user inputs while
## generating completion candidates.

#bleopt complete_polling_cycle=50


## A hint on the maximum acceptable size of any data structure generated during
## the completion process, beyond which the completion may be prematurely
## aborted to avoid excessive processing time.  "complete_limit" is used for
## TAB completion.  When its value is empty, the size checks are disabled.
## "complete_limit_auto" is used for auto-completion.  When its value is empty,
## the setting "complete_limit" is used instead. "complete_limit_auto_menu" is
## used for auto-menu.

#bleopt complete_limit=500
#bleopt complete_limit_auto=200
#bleopt complete_limit_auto_menu=100


## The following setting controls the timeout for the pathname expansions
## performed in auto-complete.  When the word contains a glob pattern that
## takes a long time to evaluate the pathname expansion, auto-complete based on
## the filename is canceled based on the timeout setting.  The value specifies
## the timeout duration in milliseconds.  When the value is empty, the
## timeout is disabled.

# bleopt complete_timeout_auto=5000


## The following setting controls the timeout for the pathname expansions to
## prepare COMP_WORDS and COMP_LINE for progcomp.  When the word contains a
## glob pattern that takes a long time to evaluate, the pathname expansion is
## canceled, and a noglob expansion is used to construct COMP_WORDS and
## COMP_LINE.  The value specifies ## the timeout duration in milliseconds.
## When the value is empty, the timeout is disabled.

# bleopt complete_timeout_compvar=200


## The following setting specifies the style of the menu to show completion
## candidates. The value "dense" and "dense-nowrap" shows candidates separated
## by spaces. "dense-nowrap" is different from "dense" in the behavior that it
## inserts a new line before the candidates that does not fit into the
## remaining part of the current line. The value "align" and "align-nowrap"
## aligns the candidates. The value "linewise" shows a candidate per line.  The
## value "desc" and "desc-raw" shows a candidate per line with description for
## each. "desc-raw" is different from "desc" in the behavior that it interprets
## ANSI escape sequences in the descriptions.

#bleopt complete_menu_style=align-nowrap


## The following setting specifies the maximal align width for
## complete_menu_style="align" and "align-nowrap".

#bleopt complete_menu_align=20


## The following setting specifies the maximal height of the menu.  When this
## value is evaluated to be a positive integer, the maximal line number of the
## menu is limited to that value.

#bleopt complete_menu_maxlines=10

## The following setting specifies the prefix for complete_menu_style=linewise.
## For example, the candidate number can be shown by setting the value "%d".
## ANSI escape sequences can be used.

#bleopt menu_linewise_prefix=


##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Color settings

## The setting "term_index_colors" specifies the number of index colors
## supported by you terminal.  The value 256 is treated as xterm 256-color
## palette (16 basic + 6x6x6 color cube + 24 gray scale). The value 88 is
## treated as xterm 88-color palette (16 basic + 4x4x4 color cube + 8 gray
## scale).  The value 0 means that the terminal does not support extra colors
## other than basic colors.

# bleopt term_index_colors=256


## The setting "term_true_colors" specifies the format of 24-bit color escape
## sequences supported by your terminal.  The value "semicolon" indicates the
## format "CSI 3 8 ; 2 ; R ; G ; B m".  The value "colon" indicates the format
## "CSI 3 8 : 2 : R : G : B m".  The other value implies that the terminal does
## not support 24-bit color sequences.  In this case, ble.sh tries to output
## indexed color sequences or basic color sequences with properly reduced
## colors.

# bleopt term_true_colors=semicolon


## The setting "filename_ls_colors" can be used to import the filename coloring
## scheme by the environment variable LS_COLORS.

# bleopt filename_ls_colors="$LS_COLORS"


## The following settings enable or disable the syntax highlighting.  When the
## setting "highlight_syntax" has a non-empty value, the syntax highlighting is
## enabled.  When the setting "highlight_filename" has a non-empty value, the
## highlighting based on the filename and the command name is enabled during
## the process of the syntax highlighting.  Similarly, when the setting
## "highlight_variable" has a non-empty value, the highlighting based on the
## variable type is enabled.  All of these settings have non-empty values by
## default.

# bleopt highlight_syntax=
# bleopt highlight_filename=
# bleopt highlight_variable=


## The following settings control the timeout and user-input cancellation of
## the pathname expansions performed in the syntax highlighting.  When the word
## contains a glob pattern that takes a long time to evaluate the pathname
## expansion, the syntax highlighting based on the filename is canceled based
## on the timeouts specified by these settings.  "highlight_timeout_sync" /
## "highlight_timeout_async" specify the timeout durations in milliseconds to
## be used for the foreground / background syntax highlighting, respectively.
## When the timeout occurred in the foreground, the syntax highlighting will be
## deferred to the background syntax highlighting.  When the timeout occurred
## in the background, the syntax highlighting for the filename is canceled.
## When the value is empty, the corresponding timeout is disabled.
## "syntax_eval_polling_interval" specifies the maximal interval between the
## user-input checking.

# bleopt highlight_timeout_sync=500
# bleopt highlight_timeout_async=5000
# bleopt syntax_eval_polling_interval=50


## The following settings specify graphic styles of each faces.

## Keybindings


## The default mapping of <SP> is magic-space which performs history and
## sabbrev expansion before inserting a space.  If you want to insert just a
## space without expansions as Bash's default, use the following setting:

#ble-bind -f 'SP' 'self-insert'


## If you want to search the already input string using <up> and <down> keys,
## use the following setting:

#ble-bind -f up 'history-search-backward'
#ble-bind -f down 'history-search-forward'


## If you want to immediately run the matched command by RET, you can specify
## the option "immediate-accept" to nsearch widgets:

#ble-bind -f up 'history-search-backward immediate-accept'
#ble-bind -f down 'history-search-forward immediate-accept'


## If you want to kill/copy words including the spaces preceding them, you can
## use the following keybindings:

#ble-bind -f C-w 'kill-region-or kill-uword'
#ble-bind -f M-w 'copy-region-or copy-uword'
